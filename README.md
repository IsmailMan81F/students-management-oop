# Student Management System (Java)

This project implements a simple student management system using object-oriented programming in Java. It models students with automatically generated unique identifiers and supports different registration scenarios, including newly registered students and transferred students with existing academic records.

Each student stores module averages, computes an overall average, and determines an academic status based on predefined evaluation rules. The design emphasizes core OOP principles such as encapsulation, constructor overloading, static attributes, and separation of responsibilities.

An administration component manages a fixed-size collection of students, allowing registration, listing, and filtering of students according to their academic performance. This project is intended as a practical exercise to reinforce object-oriented design concepts in an academic context.
